# DevSecOps + OpenShift Workshop

## Description 

Join Red Hat experts for a unique hands-on experience building, deploying, and securing containerized cloud-native applications by leveraging an assembly line approach that automates increasing levels of security assurance for each step in the process.
 
Attendees will get hands-on experience applying DevSecOps techniques in building a Secure Software Factory on OpenShift for a Java based application leveraging several containerized tools such as Gogs, Nexus, Jenkins, Sonarqube, and Eclipse Che.

## Who should attend

In the new era of containers and DevSecOps it is important for developers, operations, and security professionals to have a base understanding of containers and the surrounding ecosystem. This workshop touches on operational, development, and security concepts that are important for each discipline to be aware of.


## What you will learn

During this workshop the Red Hat team will guide you through a series of presentations and labs.  Attendees will come out of this workshop with a base understanding of containers and the container ecosystem. Customers will also get their hands on by building a Secure Software Factory for a Java based application leveraging several containerized tools such as Gogs, Nexus, Jenkins, Sonarqube, and Eclipse Che.


## Introduction
Welcome to the workshop!

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs below in order (as some build off of each other).


## Labs

These labs are built for use with [OpenShift Homeroom](https://github.com/openshift-homeroom). On the day of the workshop, you'll receive access to a dashboard which contains the labguides, a web terminal, and an embedded web console; so all you need to participate is your browser. If you'd like to review the labs in advance, you can check out the source markdown [here](https://github.com/RedHatGov/openshift-devsecops-labguides/tree/develop/tekton/workshop/content).
